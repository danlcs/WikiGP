# 🧪 WikiGP

A solo project developed during my time as a monitor at the **Senai Lab**.  
WikiGP is a simple and accessible platform, inspired by Wikipedia, created to document and showcase the best projects from the **Grand Prix Senai de Inovação** — an event where students develop innovative solutions to real-world industry challenges.

> 🚧 Although this project was developed solo, it will be passed on and maintained by future Senai Lab monitors.
